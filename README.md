# Advancement in Predictive Vehicle Collision Avoidance Technologies using ML Algorithms & Traffic Simulation

### Overview
This repository contains the code, simulation models, and related resources for our project, *Advancement in Predictive Vehicle Collision Avoidance Technologies & Traffic Simulation*. The project explores the integration of machine learning algorithms and traffic simulation techniques to predict and prevent vehicle collisions, enhancing road safety and efficiency.

### Project Goals
1. **Improve Road Safety**: Develop predictive models using ML to anticipate collisions.
2. **Enhance Traffic Flow**: Use traffic simulation tools to optimize vehicle movement and reduce congestion.
3. **Enable Real-Time Communication**: Implement V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communication for proactive collision avoidance.

### Key Features
- **Collision Prediction Algorithm**: Uses GPS, speed, and acceleration data to calculate collision probability and issue warnings.
- **Traffic Simulations**: Simulations using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to analyze traffic scenarios and validate collision avoidance measures.
- **V2V Communication**: Real-time message exchange for warning nearby vehicles about potential hazards.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Models trained on real-world and synthetic datasets for better accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**: SUMO, TraCI, TensorFlow
- **Communication Protocols**: IEEE 802.11p, WAVE
- **Simulation Tools**: NetEdit for road network modeling
